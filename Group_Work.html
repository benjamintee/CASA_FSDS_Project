<p>Opposition critics have suggested that the growth and spread of Airbnbs in London has accelerated, with professional landlords rapidly accumulating properties, flouting rental restrictions to make a profit. The increase of short-term lets and its potential to damage the housing supply in London is a concern that the Mayor’s office had raised <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-demands-licencing-scheme-prevent-short-term-lets-damaging-housing-supply">previously</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and is one of the reasons that London’s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/housing-and-land/buying-and-owning-home/guidance-short-term-and-holiday-lets-london">90-day limit</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> was introduced. Indeed, the Mayor called for a registration system to be put in place as early as <a href="www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/registration-system-for-short-term-letting-law">2019</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-the-growth-trend-in-airbnb-listings-across-london">1.1 What is the growth trend in Airbnb listings across London?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Since 2021, London has seen a dramatic increase in Airbnb listings<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> , rising from <strong>69,402</strong> to <strong>86,383 listings,</strong> a <strong>24%</strong> increase (<u>Figure 1.1</u>).</p></li>
<li><p>The majority of these listings arose between <strong>2022-2023 (↑24%</strong>) with the most evident concentrations in new listings in central London boroughs.</p></li>
<li><p>Specifically, <strong>Westminster</strong>, <strong>Camden</strong>, <strong>Southwark</strong>, <strong>Lambeth</strong> and <strong>Kensington and Chelsea</strong> saw the highest increase in listings. <strong>Westminster</strong> alone added <strong>2,947</strong> <strong>listings</strong>, a <strong>39%</strong> increase in Airbnb listings within the borough.</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-does-this-compare-to-changes-in-the-overall-housing-stock">1.2 How does this compare to changes in the overall housing stock?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In comparison with the <strong>24%</strong> <strong>increase</strong> in Airbnb listings, London housing stock increases lag significantly behind. Between 2020 and 2024, properties in London grew from <strong>3.68M</strong> to <strong>3.81M</strong> constituting a mere <strong>3.7%</strong> <strong>increase</strong> in housing stock. Amidst a tight housing market, the faster increase in properties for short-term rental relative to housing stock exacerbates pressures on housing prices and rents (<a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10124650/7/Musah_23998083211001836.pdf">Todd, Musah &amp; Cheshire (2022)</a>).</li>
<li>Unsurprisingly, when comparing the ratio of listings increases and housing stock increases at the Borough level, central London Boroughs display more accelerated rates of listings increases compared to housing stock increases than peripheral Boroughs. In particular, <strong>Kensington and Chelsea</strong> saw <strong>5 times</strong> more new Airbnb listings than new housing stock between 2020 and 2024.</li>

<ul>
<li>Across London Boroughs in 2025, the average number of listings as a percent total housing stock was <strong>1.86%</strong>, though <strong>11 Boroughs</strong> exceed this average. All <strong>11 Boroughs</strong> are located in Central London with <strong>Westminster</strong> and <strong>Kensington and Chelsea</strong> having close to <strong>6%</strong> of total housing stock listed as an Airbnb (Figure 1.2).</li>

</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>At the MSOA-level, it becomes clear that there are pockets of concentration of listings relative to housing stock in these Boroughs, with <strong>up to 1 in 8 homes (12.5%)</strong> listed for Airbnb (<u>Figure 1.3</u>). This high proportion could be driving negative sentiments in some parts of London that Airbnb could be out of control.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-many-listings-potentially-breach-the-current-90-day-limit-for-rentals">1.4 How many listings potentially breach the current 90-day limit for rentals?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since 2015, London planning rules state that entire homes / apartments let on platforms such as Airbnb should not be used for short-term letting for more than <strong>90 nights per calendar year</strong>, without planning permission obtained. This prevent permanent housing from being converted into de facto holiday accommodation. Given its negative impact , we thus focused our analysis on entire homes / apartments.</li>
<li>Based on occupancy estimates<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> ,<strong>12,081</strong> entire homes / apartments were used for more than 90 nights per year (“frequent lets”). This represented <strong>more than 2 in 10 of all entire homes listings</strong>, and <strong>1 in 8 of all listings in London</strong> that were possibly in breach of this rule.</li>
<li>Spatially, the pattern is consistent with earlier trends with Inner London Boroughs showing the highest rates of intense use. For example <strong>Westminster: 27%</strong>, <strong>Camden: 25%</strong> and <strong>Islington: 23%</strong> of entire home listings in these Boroughs were frequent lets.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the sensitivity of assumptions used by Inside Airbnb<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, we expect this to be a conservative estimate, given reported likelihood of multiple listings of the same property, which some owners have used to circumvent the 90 day rule<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. These high numbers relative to planning permissions, suggest possible misuse of Airbnbs in inner London, fanning the perception that it is out of control.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-many-professional-landlords-are-there"><strong>2. How many professional landlords are there?</strong></h2>
<section id="how-might-we-define-a-professional-landlord" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-might-we-define-a-professional-landlord">2.1 How might we define a professional landlord?</h4>
<p>The opposition proposes that “professional” landlords’ properties should be subject to increased council tax. Leaving aside the question of how this might be administered, a separate issue is how the opposition would determine which landlords are classed as “professional”.</p>
<p>In this report a “professional” landlord is defined as one:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>whose income from their Airbnb properties is <em>[greater than the median UK/London? income]</em>. This is on the basis that the meaning of the word “professional” is as a counterpart to “amateur”. In this context, “professional” suggests that the landlord could be relying on Airbnb for their living; that is, to provide the income that they would otherwise be earning through employment.</p></li>
<li><p>whose properties are residential, rather than commercial. This is based on, first, the opposition’s reference to Council Tax (which is not paid by commercial landlords; instead they pay business rates) and, second, the context for the opposition’s proposal: the letting of three “homes” (including one council-owned property) on Airbnb - the likely argument on the opposition’s part being that letting these homes on Airbnb means that they are not available either for private rental (or council tenants) or sale to buyers on the property market.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach is consistent with relevant literature investigating how Airbnb listings affect local rent and property value (Todd et al., Cox and Slee) which suggest that a professional landlord can be a company or individual that operates <u>2 or more</u> entire home / apartment listings (i.e.&nbsp;“multi-listing owners”). With this, the next two chapters focus on multi-listing owners, with an emphasis on the extent of “frequent lets” vs “standard lets”.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-many-hosts-have-listings-for-two-or-more-entire-properties-homes-apartments">2.2 How many hosts have listings for two or more entire properties (homes / apartments)?</h4>
<p>An analysis of host listings<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> shows that a <strong>small number of hosts are responsible for a disproportionately large number of listings</strong> (<u>Figure 2.1)</u>. Previous studies have found that such “multi-listing hosts” are significant drivers of increase in rent and Airbnb’s profit in London<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>27,108 (85%)</strong> hosts own <u>only 1 entire property (i.e.&nbsp;single-listing hosts)</u>, and they are responsible for <strong>47%</strong> of listings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4,966 (15%)</strong> hosts own <u>two or more properties (i.e.&nbsp;multi-listing hosts)</u>, and they disproportionately make up <strong>53%</strong> of listings.</p></li>
<li><p>A small number, <strong>15 (0.05%)</strong> of hosts, <u>own over 100 properties</u> but made up <strong>5%</strong> of the total number of entire homes available.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of the total entire home / apartment listings, a larger proportion of properties belonging to multi-listings hosts were let out for 90 or more days (14%), compared to properties belonging to single-listing hosts (7%). <em>[AS note: should we mention again that they may well have obtained planning permission?]</em></p></li>

<p>Based on estimated revenues from Inside Airbnb data<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The median single-listing host renting out their home for less than 90 days earned <strong>£4,858</strong>, while the median multi-listing host earned <strong>£5,600</strong> a year per property.</p></li>
<li><p>This rises much further when we look at <u>frequent hosts (i.e.&nbsp;occupancy ≥90 days)</u>. The median single-listing host earned <strong>£5,600</strong>, while multi-listing hosts earned <strong>30,300</strong> a year per property.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the more conservative yearly income of <strong>£4,858</strong>, **owning seven properties** becomes the threshold to make more than the London median income. In contrast, **owning just two properties** is sufficient to make close to double the median income of London when letting for more than 90 days. Given the range of income, one can definitively suggest that owning between just **2 and 7** listings is sufficient to make Airbnb a source of primary income.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-likely-pros-and-cons-of-the-oppositions-proposal-for-the-mayor-for-residents-and-for-the-city"><strong>4. What are the likely pros and cons of the opposition’s proposal (for the Mayor, for residents, and for the city)?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Not straightforward. <em>[AS note: However, we note that the recent Budget proposed changes to the Council Tax system in order to introduce the so-called “Mansion Tax”; reviewing the methods used to introduce this new tax may be instructive in determining a mechanism for introducing an Airbnb Council Tax surcharge.]</em></p></li>
<li><p>Systems-view needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any council tax adjustments will require updating of 1991 values, which would be (i) administratively difficult to implement (i.e.&nbsp;enforcement of registration), (b) have a wide-ranging impact on all residents. In particular, residents whose properties move into a higher value bracket will need to pay more tax (even if they do not rent out properties).</p></li>
<li><p>Council tax increases will reduce margins for landlords who may pass on tax increase to renters. Differentiated impact depending on whether they have deeper pockets, others may raise prices or exit the market. Also likely to see more shift towards more frequent lets (i.e.&nbsp;greater than 90 days per year).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduction in Airbnb listings. Some near-term increase in housing supply if unprofitable listings are converted to homes for sale. But longer-term likely to see more listings move to frequent lets.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher prices of rental listings may see reduction in tourist attractiveness</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, London would be seen to be taking a stricter stance on short-term lets, but overall impact of council tax increases is broad-based and sweeping.</p></li>
<li><p>Room for more progressive taxation measure targeting business owners, and those who do frequent lets (i.e.&nbsp;&gt;140 days reduce to 120 or 90 days).</p></li>
</ul></li>

</ul></td>

<ul>
<li><p>Airbnb largely operating legitimately. Supports tourism and encourages local stay. For locals, it helps to provide additional source of income.</p></li>
<li><p>But there are small number of hosts who are profiting off Airbnb and aren’t compliant. This has seen listings boom in certain areas, with disamenities to some. Additional competition raises housing prices and limiting young people from accessing these flats.</p></li>
<li><p>Main issue with housing shortage and this government will continue to focus on that instead of mindlessly raising the tax burden for everyone. Advise the mayor to double down on his plans to expand housing supply in brownfield and greyfield areas.</p></li>

<li id="fn3"><p>Mayor Calls For Registration System To Enforce Short-term Letting Law (23 Apr 2019). <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/registration-system-for-short-term-letting-law" class="uri">https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/registration-system-for-short-term-letting-law</a><a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Data from (<a href="http://insideairbnb.com/">http://insideairbnb.com</a>) which uses public information on rentals available for booking at specific months in each year.&nbsp;While owners have exercised care with data processing and cleaning, this dataset is the best publicly available estimate of Airbnb listings. We further process the data to remove listings with duplicate IDs, or more than six null fields, which typically reflects the fact that entries have no reviews or incomplete information. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Occupancy estimates are obtained from Inside Airbnb data. First, a review rate is used to compute reviews to estimated bookings. Thereafter, the average length of stay for London was multiplied by the estimated bookings for each listing giving the occupancy rate (out of 365 days). To estimate potential breaches, we look at the subset of listings that are “entire homes / apartments”, and the occupancy rate, which estimates how many nights the listing was booked in the last 365 days, providing a useful proxy for annual use, where raw daily calendar data are unavailable.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>The occupancy model assumed (a) a review rate of 50% and (b) average length of stay of 3.1 days for London. This is conservative given that Airbnb previously cited an average review rate of 78%, and, community forums have cited a range of 33% and 85% for various properties.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>BBC journalists found about 1,300 listings had reused identical images - such as the same furniture, rooms and decor - from other supposedly unique listing. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg96rz9061o" class="uri">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg96rz9061o</a><a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
