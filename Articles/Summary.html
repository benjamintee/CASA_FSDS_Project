<li><p>Two channels: (a) inducing landlords to switch from supplying long-term rentals to short-term rentals, (b) enables homeowners to generate income from excess housing capacity which raises the value of owning relative to renting, increases price-to-rent ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>Recommends approaches to limit the reallocation of housing stock from long-term to short-term rentals, without discouraging use of home-sharing. Occupancy tax or proof of owner-occupancy requirements.</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Airbnb distorts the housing market in two ways (a) conversion – unit previously occupied by city resident but now listed is unit removed from rental market, typically in core regions, reducing housing supply and affordable housing supply (b) hotelisation – incentive to list units for tourists over locals due to ‘rent-controlled rent’.</p></li>
<li><p>Results in bidding up of rents as public sector cannot swifty replace the housing units that Airbnb removes from the marketplace.</p></li>
<li><p>Particularly affects high density neighbourhoods, tight housing markets with near-zero vacancy rates, and could be exacerbated by annual increases in residential demand.</p></li>
<li><p>Leads to citywide reduction in affordable housing – given that affordable units are particularly attractive for conversion, reducing stock. Incentivizes the direct conversion of subsidised or rent-controlled units into lucrative Airbnb listings.</p></li>
<li><p>Other phenomena such as displacement, gentrification through rising rents, exacerbates social inequality through displacement of lower income tenants.</p></li>

<li><p>Airbnb acts as instrument that contributes to financialization of housing – short-term rentals offer numerous benefits that encourage market efficiency for property owners, making them increasingly attractive for local and global investors.

<li><p>Spatial location of Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with a single dwelling type – purpose-built flats, conversions and flats in commercial buildings.</p></li>

(b) scarcity of developable land in London (c) regulatory constraints and housing policies that seeks to target first-time buyers pushes prices up further due to increase in demand that outstrips supply (d) London is centre of speculative market with overseas landlords and buy-to-let landlords who buy without intention to live in property (e) rise of private companies that manage airbnb properties in exchange for profit share</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Economic costs of Airbnb likely outweigh the benefits. costs to renters and local jurisdictions likely exceed the benefits to travellers and property owners.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence that Airbnb increases the supply of short-term travel accommodations and slightly lower prices. But there is little evidence that the high price of travel accommodations is a pressing economic problem in the United States:</p></li>
<li><p>Instead, rising housing costs are a key problem for American families, and evidence suggests that the presence of Airbnb raises local housing costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Property owners can diversify into short-term rentals and increase return on assets. However, housing wealth is primarily concentrated among the top 20%.</p>
<p>(2) Increased options and price competition for travellers accommodations.&nbsp;However, this is in effect a redistribution of welfare, and not an increase in overall economy wide welfare. Little effect on developers building more accommodation in the city but instead results in a conversion of long-term rental units into short-term rental units.</p>
<p>(3) Increased tourism spending and economic prospects of cities. However, relies on assumption that&nbsp;<em>all</em> spending done by travellers staying at Airbnb properties is spending that would not have been done had Airbnb not existed.</p></li>
<li><p>Costs:</p>
<p>(1) Long-term renters face higher housing costs.</p>
<p>(2) Local government tax collections fall</p>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Close spatial relationship between Airbnb and hotels, with a marked center periphery pattern. Airbnb predominates around the city’s main hotel axis and hotels predominate in some peripheral areas of the city.</p></li>
<li><p>Airbnb argues that listings are more scattered than hotels, so guests are likely to disperse their spending in neighbourhoods that do not typically recieve tourists.</p></li>
<li><p>However, in reality Airbnb is able to expand freely without zoning requirements, resulting in faster expansions in historic centers which aggrevates the problem of crowding and tourism gentrification. Evidenced by concentrated accomodation found in ring around the central hub of the city, the Plaza de Cataluna, where the presence of Airbnb was greater in relative terms than hotels. Exacerbates tourism pressures in central areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the number of reviews per month as a proxy for the level of occupation of the lodgings, an average value of 1.48 was obtained for the city center compared to 1.14 for the rest.</p></li>
<li><p>54% were entire homes / apartments, 45% were private rooms and 1% were shared rooms. Proportion of Airbnb hosts who rent out more than one room was 27%, 22% of the total number of rooms were rented out by hosts who offer more than 5 rooms.

<li><p>Proponents of the sharing economy argue that it will bring many benefits including income from the users of such services, better resource allocation and utilization and new economic activities for cities and municipalities. Detractors argue that negative externalities generated by sharing economy far outpace benefits - sharing economy more about economic self-interest, and for being predatory and exploitative.</p></li>
<li><p>By June 2015, London had over 14,000 Airbnb properties listed.</p></li>
<li><p>Airbnb listings seem to be correlated with the distance from the city center. Airbnb properties are associated with attractive and well-to-do areas with young and tech-savvy residents.</p></li>
<li><p>Airbnb rooms tend to be offered in areas with highly educated non-UK born renters while homes tend to be offered in areas with owners of high-end homes in terms of house price.</p></li>
<li><p>Recommendations: (1) Expore “transferable sharing rights” based on real-time market demand and municipal policies, and deal with externalities created by short-term rentals (2) Regulation of short-term rentals to avoid compromising the character and ambiance of municipalities (3) Should be differentiated between room and entire apartments.</p></li>

<td>Data audit of Inside Airbnb dataset.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Identified possible issues of incorrect data added to insideairbnb dataset, due to new features included by airbnb.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitations of insideairbnb dataset, website due to nature of web-scraping. Subject to web-scraper’s performance, and affected by ‘spam’ included by airbnb’s to weed out scrapers. Inside Airbnb only provides minimal information on the data collection process with the use of python scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>Main issue arises from the process of comparing between listings.csv.gz to reviews.csv.gz, and the assumption that one review is only related to one listing. Since Nov 2016, Airbnb introduced “Airbnb experiences” which also carries unique ID for the same property, but might give rise to reviews for an experience instead of a home stay.</p></li>
<li><p>Low number of IDs with incorrect data suggest that while issue requires attention, not severe to affect published papers.</p></li>
<li><p>Possible issue of reproduceability due to presence of multiple subsets and versions of the dataset.</p></li>
