# Briefing on Airbnb Growth Trends & Policy Implications

## **Executive Summary**

This report provides an analysis of Airbnb activity in London in recent years (2021-2025), with a focus on 2025. Given time-sensitivity amidst the impending election, and a data-poor environment, we utilise appropriate data-driven approaches to provide insight into the following questions:

a.      Is Airbnb out of control in London?

b.      How many professional landlords are there?

c.      How many properties would be affected by the opposition’s proposal?

d.      What are the benefits and trade-offs with the opposition’s proposal?

e.      What are options to reframe the narrative to one about social mobility and housing opportunity?

### Key Findings

## **1. Is Airbnb ‘out of control’ in London?**

Opposition critics have suggested that the growth and spread of Airbnb’s in London has accelerated, with professional landlords rapidly accumulating properties, flouting rental restrictions to make a profit. This chapter provides a systematic analysis of the situation.
