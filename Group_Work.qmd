# Briefing on Airbnb Growth Trends & Policy Implications

### **1. Is Airbnb ‘out of control’ in London?**

Opposition critics have suggested that the growth and spread of Airbnb’s in London has accelerated, with professional landlords rapidly accumulating properties, flouting rental restrictions to make a profit. This chapter provides a systematic analysis of the situation.

#### What is the growth trend in Airbnb listings across London?

Since 2021 London has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of Airbnb listings rising from **69,298** to **86,463** in 2025, a **25% increase**. The majority of these listings arose between 2022 and 2023 with the most evident concentration of new listings appearing in central London boroughs. Specifically, the boroughs of Westminster, Camden, Southwark, Lambeth, and Kensington and Chelsea saw the highest increases in listings, Westminster alone adding nearly **3,000** listings constituting a **39% increase** in available Airbnbs within the borough.

#### How does this compare to changes in the overall housing stock?

In comparison to the **25% increase** of Airbnb listings, London housing stock increases lag significantly behind. Between 2020 and 2024, London grew from **3.68M to 3.81M** properties constituting a relatively mere **3.7% increase** in housing stock. Unsurprisingly, when comparing the ratio of listings increases and housing stock increases at the borough level, central London boroughs display more accelerated rates of listings increases when compared to housing stock increases than peripheral boroughs. In particular Kensington and Chelsea saw **5 times** more new Airbnb listings than new housing stock between 2020 and 2024.

Across all London boroughs in 2025, the average amount of listings as a percent total housing stock is **1.86%**, though eleven boroughs exceed this average. All eleven boroughs are located in central London with Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea having close to **6%** of their total housing stock listed as an Airbnb. The combination of this accelerated and geographically concentrated growth in listings and a tightening housing market suggests that Airbnb can be considered out of control, particularly within central London boroughs.

#### How many listings potentially breach the current 90-day limit for rentals?

Since 2017, London planning rules state that entire homes let on platforms such as Airbnb should not be used for short-term letting for more than 90 nights per calendar year, without planning permission obtained. This prevents permanent housing from being converted into de facto holiday accommodation.

Considering just *Entire Home/Apt* listings (67% of all listings), **12,081 or 21%** of listings exceed the 90 day limit, and assuming multiple listings of the same property this evaluation should be considered conservative. Additonally, it is once again central London Boroughs that display the highest rates of excessive use with eight central boroughs having over **20%** of listings let for more than 90 days.

### **2. How many professional landlords are there?**

Relevent literature investigating how Airbnb listings affect local rent and property value (Todd et al., Cox and Slee) suggest that a commercial or professional landlord can be a company or individual that owns and operates 2 or more *Entire Home/Apt* listings.

**NOTE TO SELF: ADMIN DOCUMENT AND DISCUSSIONS USED FOR THE NEXT PARTS!! THEN SEND PULL REQUEST BEN**n

### **3. How many properties would be affected by the opposition’s proposal?**

Draft answer due Week 9.

### **4. What are the likely pros and cons of the opposition’s proposal (for the Mayor, for residents, and for the city)?**

### **5. Can the story be reframed as a positive one about social mobility or housing opportunity?**
