Given time-sensitivity amidst the impending election, and a data-poor environment, we utilise appropriate data-driven approaches to provide insight into the following questions:\n\na.      Is Airbnb out of control in London?\n\nb.      How many professional landlords are there?\n\nc.      How many properties would be affected by the opposition’s proposal?\n\nd.      What are the benefits and trade-offs with the opposition’s proposal?\n\ne.      What are options to reframe the narrative to one about social mobility and housing opportunity?\n\n### Key Findings\n\n*(Insert findings in 2 column table)*\n\n### Recommendations\n\n*(Insert recommendations here)*\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## **1. Is Airbnb ‘out of control’ in London?**\n\nOpposition critics have suggested that the growth and spread of Airbnb’s in London has accelerated, with professional landlords rapidly accumulating properties, flouting rental restrictions to make a profit. This chapter provides a systematic analysis of the situation. \n\n\n\n#### 1.1 What is the growth trend in Airbnb listings across London?\n\n#### 1.2 Which areas saw the fastest growth in Airbnb listings?\n\n#### 1.3 How does this compare to changes in the overall housing stock?\n\n#### 1.4 What is the situation at the Borough- and MSOA-levels in 2025? Are issues widespread or localised?\n\n#### 1.5 How many listings potentially breach the current 90-day limit for rentals?\n\n#### 1.6 Why might this be a problem and what is the impact on communities?\n\n## **2. How many professional landlords are there?**\n\n#### 2.1 What is the distribution of Airbnb types in London?\n\n#### 2.2 What is the difference between a professional landlord and a commercial landlord? Does this matter for analysis?\n\n#### 2.3 How many hosts own 2 or more Airbnb properties, and what is the range of the number of listings per host?\n\n#### 2.4 What is the average income from these properties, and how does it compare with median / average incomes in London?\n\n#### 2.5 What is the profile of these hosts ?\n\n## **3. How many properties would be affected by the opposition’s proposal?**\n\nDraft answer due Week 9.\n\n## **4. What are the likely pros and cons of the opposition’s proposal (for the Mayor, for residents, and for the city)?**\n\n## **5. Can the story be reframed as a positive one about social mobility or housing opportunity?**\n\n## References\n\n",
